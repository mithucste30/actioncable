module ActionCable
  module Channel
    # Streams allow channels to route broadcastings to the subscriber. A broadcasting is, as discussed elsewhere, a pub/sub queue where any data
    # put into it is automatically sent to the clients that are connected at that time. It's purely an online queue, though. If you're not
    # streaming a broadcasting at the very moment it sends out an update, you'll not get that update when connecting later.
    #
    # Most commonly, the streamed broadcast is sent straight to the subscriber on the client-side. The channel just acts as a connector between
    # the two parties (the broadcaster and the channel subscriber). Here's an example of a channel that allows subscribers to get all new
    # comments on a given page:
    #
    #   class CommentsChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #     def follow(data)
    #       stream_from "comments_for_#{data['recording_id']}"
    #     end
    #
    #     def unfollow
    #       stop_all_streams
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # So the subscribers of this channel will get whatever data is put into the, let's say, `comments_for_45` broadcasting as soon as it's put there.
    # That looks like so from that side of things:
    #
    #   ActionCable.server.broadcast "comments_for_45", author: 'DHH', content: 'Rails is just swell'
    #
    # If you have a stream that is related to a model, then the broadcasting used can be generated from the model and channel.
    # The following example would subscribe to a broadcasting like `comments:Z2lkOi8vVGVzdEFwcC9Qb3N0LzE`
    #
    #   class CommentsChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #     def subscribed
    #       post = Post.find(params[:id])
    #       stream_for post
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # You can then broadcast to this channel using:
    #
    #   CommentsChannel.broadcast_to(@post, @comment)
    #
    # If you don't just want to parlay the broadcast unfiltered to the subscriber, you can supply a callback that lets you alter what goes out.
    # Example below shows how you can use this to provide performance introspection in the process:
    #
    #   class ChatChannel < ApplicationCable::Channel
    #    def subscribed
    #      @room = Chat::Room[params[:room_number]]
    #
    #      stream_for @room, -> (encoded_message) do
    #        message = ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(encoded_message)
    #
    #        if message['originated_at'].present?
    #          elapsed_time = (Time.now.to_f - message['originated_at']).round(2)
    #
    #          ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument :performance, measurement: 'Chat.message_delay', value: elapsed_time, action: :timing
    #          logger.info "Message took #{elapsed_time}s to arrive"
    #        end
    #
    #        transmit message
    #      end
    #    end
    #
    # You can stop streaming from all broadcasts by calling #stop_all_streams.
